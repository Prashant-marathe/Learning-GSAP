GSAP Learning Projects üöÄ
Welcome to my repository showing my journey with GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)! This repo contains hands-on mini-projects and examples which helped me learn core GSAP concepts, including gsap.to, gsap.from, timeline animations, ScrollTrigger, and more.

üìÅ Repository Structure
PART-1, PART-2, PART-3: My study notes, code snippets, and experiments while learning GSAP.

Project-1 to Project-5: Individual hands-on projects, each focused on one or more GSAP features.

‚ú® What I Learned
gsap.to & gsap.from
Animating DOM elements from/to specific values, customizing properties and sequencing actions.

Timelines
Creating organized, sequential (or overlapping) animation flows.

ScrollTrigger
Animating elements based on scroll position for modern interactive effects.

Easing, Stagger, Repeat & Yoyo
Building more natural and complex effects by controlling motion and repetition.

Callbacks & Events
Synchronizing animations with UI or user actions.

üõ†Ô∏è Projects Overview
Below are the highlights of what each project taught me:

Project	Key GSAP Concepts Used
Project-1	Basics of gsap.to for element transition
Project-2	Entry effects with gsap.from
Project-3	Animations sequencing via Timelines
Project-4	Scroll-based triggers with ScrollTrigger
Project-5	Advanced GSAP: easing, stagger, callbacks
üö© Getting Started
Clone this repository

Open any project folder (Project-1 to Project-5)

Open index.html in a browser to see the demo

All projects use plain HTML/CSS/JS for simplicity.

üìù Reflection
By building these projects, I:

Practiced the most-used GSAP APIs in real examples

Understood how to combine multiple GSAP concepts within a real-world scenario

Gained confidence to use GSAP creatively for interactive, performant web animations

Feel free to fork, star, or build on these examples. If you have feedback or want to reach out, create an issue or pull request.

Happy animating! ‚ú®GSAP Learning Projects üöÄ
