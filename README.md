GSAP Learning Projects Repository 
Welcome to my collection of hands-on projects and study materials documenting my journey learning GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)! This repository contains practical projects exploring various animation techniques using GSAP, from cursor effects to scroll-based animations.

üìÅ Repository Structure
PART-1, PART-2, PART-3
Study notes, code snippets, and incremental experiments as I delve deeper into GSAP concepts and APIs.

Project -1 (custom cursor)
Creating a custom cursor effect with GSAP animations for smooth following and interaction.

Project -2 (Animation Navigation Menu)
Building an animated navigation menu emphasizing stylish transitions using gsap.to and timelines.

Project -3 (Animated heading)
Applying text and heading animations showcasing entrance and stagger effects with GSAP.

Project -4 (scrolling based animation)
Using ScrollTrigger to activate and control animations based on scroll position for interactive UX.

Project -5 (Animated Website)
A fully animated website prototype combining multiple GSAP techniques for a cohesive experience.

‚ú® Key GSAP Concepts Covered
gsap.to & gsap.from: Controlling element animations from and to various states.

Timeline: Creating sequenced and synchronized animation flows.

ScrollTrigger: Linking animations to scroll position for dynamic, scroll-based effects.

Stagger & Easing: Adding natural motion and delays to multiple elements.

Advanced Techniques: Custom cursors, animated navigation, and integrated UI animations.

üìù My Learning Journey
While building these projects, I:

Gained practical experience with GSAP‚Äôs core APIs and plugins.

Improved my ability to sequence and synchronize animations using timelines.

Mastered scroll-based triggers for modern web interactions.

Learned to combine animations for creating polished UI prototypes.

Built confidence to experiment with custom animated effects.

Feel free to explore, fork, or adapt these projects. Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

Happy animating! ‚ú®
