- **Project -1 (custom cursor)**  
  *Animated custom cursor that follows the mouse and interacts with elements, showcasing GSAP basics.*

- **Project -2 (Animation Navigation Menu)**  
  *An animated navigation menu using `gsap.to` and timelines, focusing on transition effects for menu items.*

- **Project -3 (Animated heading)**  
  *Creative text and heading animations using staggered entrances with GSAP.*

- **Project -4 (scrolling based animation)**  
  *Scroll-triggered animations using `ScrollTrigger` for dynamic, engaging scroll experiences.*

- **Project -5 (Animated Website)**  
  *A fully animated website prototype‚Äîcombining different GSAP techniques cohesively.*
